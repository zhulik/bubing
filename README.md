## What is it?
Bubing is a tool for bundling linux applications for running it on every linux distribution. It bundles all app's
dependencies in one folder and creates run script(and some other features described below). Bundled application can be run on
all linux distros with kernel newer than 2.6. Bundling tested on ArchLinux and Ubuntu in 32 and 64 bit architectures,
any other distros, probably, suitable too.

Command `file` must be available!

*This is linux-only solution now, i have no requirement for bundling apps on MacOS or Windows, but this ports are welcome*

## Who need it?
If you developing proprietary software for linux and you must deploy it on outdated/old/exotic linux distributions or user's
machines, you need it.

## Usage

### Installation
Firstly, you must install ruby >= 2.0.0 (apt-get, rvm, any other way).

Then, install bubing gem

`gem install bubing`

That's all!
